    <p>Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. As we approach the end of the year, it&#x27;s natural to look back on the progress that has been made toward our dual mandate objectives.</p>
    <p>Inflation has eased from its highs, and this has come without a significant increase in unemployment. That&#x27;s very good news. But inflation is still too high. Ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain.</p>
    <p>As we look ahead to next year, I want to assure the American people that we&#x27;re fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal. Ongoing price stability is essential to achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.</p>
    <p>Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. We&#x27;ve raised our policy interest rate by five and a quarter percentage points and have continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace. Our actions have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory, meaning that tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation, and the full effects of our tightening likely have not yet been felt.</p>
    <p>Today we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Given how far we have come, along with the uncertainties and risks that we face, the committee is proceeding carefully. We will make decisions about the extent of any additional policy affirming and how long policy will remain restrictive based on the totality of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</p>
    <p>I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity has slowed substantially from the outsized pace seen in the third quarter. Even so, GDP is on track to expand around 2.5 percent for the year as a whole, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply conditions.</p>
    <p>After picking somewhat over the-up somewhat over the summer, activity in the housing sector has flattened out and remains well below the levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. In our summary of economic projections, committee participants revised up their assessments of GDP growth this year, but expect growth to cool, with the median projection falling to 1.4 percent next year.</p>
    <p>The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 204,000 jobs per month, a strong pace that is nevertheless below that seen earlier in the year. The unemployment rate remains low, at 3.7 percent.</p>
    <p>Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers. The labor force participation rate has moved up since last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has returned to pre-pandemic levels. Nominal wage growth appears to be easing, and job vacancies have declined. Although the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers.</p>
    <p>FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward pressures on inflation. The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises somewhat from 3.8 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent at the end of next year.</p>
    <p>Inflation has eased over the past year, but remains above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Based on the Consumer Price Index and other data, we estimate that total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in November, and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 3.1 percent. The lower inflation readings over the past several months are welcome, but we will need to see further evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal.</p>
    <p>Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well-anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. As is evident from the SEP, we anticipate that the process of getting inflation all the way to 2 percent will take some time. The median projection in the SEP is 2.8 percent this year, falls to 2.4 percent next year, and reaches 2 percent in 2026.</p>
    <p>The Fed&#x27;s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We&#x27;re highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.</p>
    <p>As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by five and a quarter percentage points, and we have decreased our securities holdings by more than a trillion dollars. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. The Committee decided at today&#x27;s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at five and a quarter to five and a half percent, and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.</p>
    <p>While we believe that our policy rate is likely at or near its peak for this tightening cycle, the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since the pandemic, and ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured. We are prepared to tighten policy further, if appropriate. We&#x27;re committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent over time, and to keeping policy restrictive.</p>
    <p>INTERVIEWER: Until we&#x27;re confident that inflation is on the path to that objective. In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward. While participants do not view it as likely to be appropriate to raise interest rates further, neither do they want to take the possibility off the table.</p>
    <p>INTERVIEWER: If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.6 percent at the end of 2024, 3.6 percent at the end of 2025, and 2.9 percent at the end of 2026, still above the median longer-term rate. These projections are not a committee decision or plan.</p>
    <p>INTERVIEWER: If the economy does not evolve as projected, the path of policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum employment and price stability goals. In light of the uncertainties and risks and how far we have come, the Committee is proceeding carefully.</p>
    <p>INTERVIEWER: We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks.</p>
    <p>INTERVIEWER: In determining the extent of any additional policy affirming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.</p>
    <p>INTERVIEWER: We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.</p>
    <p>INTERVIEWER: To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.</p>
    <p>INTERVIEWER: Chris Ruegeber at Associated Press. I wanted to ask how should we interpret the addition of the word any before additional firming in the statement? I mean, does that mean that you&#x27;re pretty much done with rate hikes and the Committee has shifted away from a tightening bias and toward a more neutral stance?</p>
    <p>INTERVIEWEE: So specifically on any, we do say that in determining the extent of any additional policy firming that may be appropriate, so any additional policy firming in that sense. So we added the word any as an acknowledgement that we believe that we are likely at or near the peak rate for this cycle. Participants didn&#x27;t write down additional hikes that we believe are likely. So that&#x27;s what we wrote down. But participants also didn&#x27;t want to take the possibility of further hikes off the table.</p>
    <p>INTERVIEWER: Steve Leesman, CNBC. Happy holidays, Mr. Chairman. Fed Governor Chris Waller said that if inflation continues to fall, then the Fed in the next several months could be cutting interest rates. I wonder if you could comment on whether you agree with Fed Governor Waller on that, that the Fed would become more restrictive if it didn&#x27;t cut rates if inflation fell.</p>
    <p>INTERVIEWEE: So, of course, I don&#x27;t comment on any other officials, even those who work at the Fed. But I&#x27;ll try to answer your question more broadly. So the way we&#x27;re looking at it is really this. When we started out, right, we said the first question is how fast to move, and we moved very fast. The second question is, you know, really how high to raise the policy rate. And that&#x27;s really the question that we&#x27;re still on here. We&#x27;re very focused on that.</p>
    <p>INTERVIEWEE: As I mentioned, people generally think that we&#x27;re at or near that and think it&#x27;s not likely that we will hike, although they don&#x27;t take that possibility off the table. So that&#x27;s - when you get to that question and that&#x27;s your answer, there&#x27;s a natural — naturally, it begins to be the next question, which is when it will become appropriate to begin dialing back the amount of policy restraint that&#x27;s in place.</p>
    <p>INTERVIEWEE: That&#x27;s really the next question, and that&#x27;s what people are thinking about and talking about. And I would just say this. We are seeing, you know, strong growth that is - that appears to be moderating. We&#x27;re seeing a labor market that is coming back into balance by so many measures, and we&#x27;re seeing inflation making real progress.</p>
    <p>INTERVIEWER: Can you give some more - the nature of that discussion today?</p>
    <p>INTERVIEWEE: Sure. It comes up in this way today. Everybody wrote down an SEP forecast, so many people mentioned what their rate forecast was, and there was no back and forth, no attempt to sort of reach agreement, like this is what I wrote down, this is what I think, that kind of thing, and preliminary kind of a discussion like that. Not everybody did that, but many people did. And then - and I would say there&#x27;s a general expectation that this will be a topic for us looking ahead.</p>
    <p>Interviewer: That&#x27;s really what happened in today&#x27;s meeting. I can&#x27;t do the head count for you in real time, but that&#x27;s generally what happened today.</p>
    <p>Interviewer: I have a question for Rachel. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post: Hi, Chair Powell, Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks for taking our questions. At this point, can you confidently say that the economy has avoided a recession and isn&#x27;t heading for one now? And if the answer is no, I&#x27;m curious about what you&#x27;d still be looking for.</p>
    <p>CHAIR POWELL: I think you can say that there&#x27;s little basis for thinking that the economy is in a recession now. I would say that. I think there&#x27;s always a probability that there will be a recession in the next year, and it&#x27;s a meaningful probability no matter what the economy is doing. So it&#x27;s always a real possibility. The question is, is it — so it&#x27;s a possibility here.</p>
    <p>CHAIR POWELL: I have always felt, since the beginning, that there was a possibility, because of the unusual situation, that the economy could cool off in a way that enabled inflation to come down without the kind of large job losses that have often been associated with high inflation and tightening cycles. So far, that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re seeing, that&#x27;s what many forecasters on and off the Committee are seeing. This result is not guaranteed. It is far too early to declare victory, and there are certainly risks. It&#x27;s certainly possible that the economy will behave in an unexpected way.</p>
    <p>Interviewer: I&#x27;m curious, if you&#x27;re looking back on the past year, you talked about navigating by the stars under cloudy skies. Can you talk about some of the ways in which the economy surprised you most this year, where you thought it would behave in one way and had to pivot to respond?</p>
    <p>CHAIR POWELL: So I think forecasters generally, if you go back a year, were very broadly forecasting a recession for this year, for 2023. And not only did that not happen - that includes Fed forecasters and really essentially all forecasters, a very high proportion of forecasters, very weak growth or a recession - not only did that not happen, we actually had a very strong year.</p>
    <p>CHAIR POWELL: And that was a combination of strong demand, but also real gains on the supply side. So this was the year when labor force participation picked up or immigration picked up, where the distortions to supply and demand from the pandemic, you know, the shortages and the bottlenecks, really began to unwind.</p>
    <p>CHAIR POWELL: So we had significant supply side gains with strong demand, and we got what looks like a 2.5 percent plus or a little more than that growth year at a time when potential growth this year might even have been higher than that just because of the healing on the supply side. So that was a surprise to just about everybody.</p>
    <p>CHAIR POWELL: I think the inflation forecast is roughly what people wrote down a year ago, but in a very different setting. And I would say the labor market, because of the stronger growth, has also been significantly better. If you look back at the SEP from a year ago, there was a significant increase in unemployment that didn&#x27;t really happen. We&#x27;re still at 3.7 percent. So we&#x27;ve seen, you know, strong growth, still a tight labor market, but one that&#x27;s coming back into balance with the, with support from the supply side, a greater supply of labor.</p>
    <p>Howard Schneider with Reuters: Thanks, Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for taking the questions. I wonder if you could give a little more color and detail on what motivates the lower rates next year, whether it&#x27;s a coincidence, for example, that the spread between PCE inflation, core inflation, and the federal funds rate stays constant over the year. Are you simply calibrating against the fall in prices, in the price level that you&#x27;re seeing, in the rate of inflation that you&#x27;re expecting, as opposed to supporting the economy?</p>
    <p>CHAIR POWELL: Nothing quite that mechanical is happening. The SEP really is a bottoms up, built from the bottom up, right? So I think people are looking at what&#x27;s happening in the economy, and I think if you look at the big difference from September in the SEP, the expectations for inflation this year, both headline and core, have come down, you know, really significantly in three months. That&#x27;s a big piece of this.</p>
    <p>CHAIR POWELL: At the same time, growth has turned out to be very strong, and the third quarter is slowing, we believe, as appropriate. And we&#x27;ve had several labor market reports which suggest, again, significant progress toward greater balance across a very broad range of indicators. You&#x27;re seeing so many of the indicators coming back to normal, not all of them.</p>
    <p>CHAIR POWELL: So I think that people look at that, and they write down their - basically, each individual writes down a forecast and a rate forecast that goes with that forecast. We tabulate them and publish it. And so it&#x27;s not - it isn&#x27;t - you ask about real rates, I take it. You know, that is something that we&#x27;re very conscious of and aware of and monitor, and it&#x27;s certainly a big part of - it&#x27;s a part of how we think about things, but really it&#x27;s broader financial conditions that matter.</p>
    <p>CHAIR POWELL: And as you well know, it&#x27;s so hard to know exactly what the real rate is or exactly how tight policy is at any given time. So you couldn&#x27;t follow that like it was a rule and think that you would get the right answer all the time. But it&#x27;s certainly something that we&#x27;re focused on, and indeed, if you look at the projections, I think the expectation would be that the real is declining as we move forward.</p>
    <p>Question: And it sounds like the discussion over that, if I could follow up, has already kind of begun. I&#x27;m wondering, just related to Steve&#x27;s question, how the tactics of this play out, the slowing of inflation and the fact that the deeper you get into 2024, the closer you get to a presidential election. Do you want to front-load this, in other words?</p>
    <p>CHAIR POWELL: Yeah, no, we don&#x27;t think about political events, we don&#x27;t think about politics. We think about what&#x27;s the right thing to do for the economy. The minute we start thinking about those things, you know, we just can&#x27;t do that. We have to think what&#x27;s the right thing. We&#x27;ll do the things that we think are right for the economy at the time we — when we think is the right time. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;ll always do.</p>
    <p>CHAIR POWELL: So I mentioned we&#x27;re moving carefully. One of the things we&#x27;re moving carefully about is that decision over-that assessment, really, over whether we&#x27;ve done enough, really. And you see that people are not writing down rate hikes. That&#x27;s us thinking that we have done enough, but not feeling that really strongly confidently and not wanting to take the possibility of a rate hike off the table. Nonetheless, it&#x27;s not the base case anymore, obviously, as it was, you know, 60, 90 days ago.</p>
    <p>Question: Nick Timuros, The Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, you&#x27;ve argued over the last year that policy tightening started before you actually lifted off because the market anticipated your moves and tightened on your behalf. The market is now easing policy on your behalf by anticipating a funds rate by next September that&#x27;s a full point below the current level with cuts beginning around March. Is this something that you are broadly comfortable with?</p>
    <p>CHAIR POWELL: So this last year has been remarkable for the sort of seesaw thing back and forth we&#x27;ve had over the course of the year of markets moving away and moving back and that kind of thing.</p>
    <p>Question: Markets seem to think inflation is coming down credibly. Do you believe we&#x27;re at the point where inflation is coming down credibly?</p>
    <p>CHAIR POWELL: Listen, I welcome the progress. I think it&#x27;s really good to see the progress that we&#x27;re making.</p>
    <p>Question: Gina Smilich, New York Times. Thanks for taking our questions. In the SEP from today, growth is notably below potential in 2024. If growth were to surprise us again in the way that it has for years now by being stronger than expected next year, would it still be possible to cut rates?</p>
    <p>CHAIR POWELL: We&#x27;ll look at the totality of the data. Growth is one thing, so is inflation, so is labor market data. So we&#x27;d look at the totality - as we make decisions about policy changes going forward, we&#x27;re going to look at all those things, and particularly about the - as they affect the outlook.</p>
    <p>CHAIR POWELL: We will get it down to percent. But, you know, if we see stronger growth, we will set policy according to what we actually see. And so that&#x27;s how I would answer.</p>
    <p>Questioner: I guess the question I&#x27;m asking, if you don&#x27;t mind a quick follow-up, I guess the question I&#x27;m asking is, is above-trend growth itself a problem?</p>
    <p>CHAIR POWELL: It&#x27;s only a problem in - it&#x27;s not itself a problem. It&#x27;s only a problem insofar as it makes it more difficult for us to achieve our goals. And if, you know, if you have growth that&#x27;s robust, what that will mean is probably we&#x27;ll keep the labor market very strong. It probably will place some upward pressure on inflation. That could mean that it takes longer to get to 2 percent inflation. That could mean we need to keep rates higher for longer. It could even mean, ultimately, that we would need to hike again. It just is - it&#x27;s the way — the way our policy works.</p>
    <p>Questioner: Good. Neil?</p>
    <p>Neil: Hi, Chair Powell. Neil Erwin with Axios. How do you interpret the state of the labor market right now? And in particular, you&#x27;ve referred, even today, to evidence that it&#x27;s coming into better balance. What would you need to see to conclude that it has reached that balance?</p>
    <p>CHAIR POWELL: Well, on the better balance side, there&#x27;s just a lot of things. It&#x27;s - you see job growth still strong, but moving back down to more sustainable levels, given population growth and labor force participation.</p>
    <p>Questioner: Jones, Financial Times. I&#x27;d say the mood among economists at the moment seems to be one of cautious optimism, which is somewhat corroborated by your forecast by this sense that we are going to have a soft landing.</p>
    <p>CHAIR POWELL: Yeah, Len, when we hear from the general public, there&#x27;s a lot of discord about economic conditions. What do you think explains this disconnect, and does it matter for policymakers?</p>
    <p>Questioner: Victoria. Hi, Victoria Guido with Politico. I wanted to ask, you know, on the flip side of if things start to deteriorate rapidly, if we do fall into a recession, if we do start to see unemployment rise, at sort of the levels of inflation that we&#x27;re seeing now, how would you all think about that in terms of rate cuts? Would that be a sign that you&#x27;ve done your job demand-wise?</p>
    <p>CHAIR POWELL: Sorry, if? If the economy starts to - looks like it&#x27;s starting to fall into a recession, if the jobless rate starts to rise? That&#x27;s not something we&#x27;re hoping to see.</p>
    <p>Questioner: But would you take that as a signal that you should cut rates?</p>
    <p>Interviewer: Obviously, what we&#x27;ll do is we&#x27;ll look at the totality of the data, as l&#x27;ve mentioned a couple of times, and certainly the labor data would be important in that.</p>
    <p>Questioner: Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television Radio. Mr. Chairman, you were, by your own admission, behind the curve in starting to raise rates to fight inflation, and you said earlier, again, the full effects of our tightening cycle have not yet been felt.</p>
    <p>Interviewee: How will you decide when to adjust rates, and how will you ensure you&#x27;re not behind the curve there?</p>
    <p>Chair Powell: So we&#x27;re aware of the risk that we would linger on too long. We know that&#x27;s a risk and we&#x27;re very focused on not making that mistake. We regard our two mandates as a balance. Previously, we focused heavily on the price stability mandate, due to the distance from one mandate. But now, we&#x27;re reaching a point where both mandates are in a balance. This will be kept in mind as we make policy going forward. We&#x27;ll be observing the demand and growth of the economy, which we predict will be lower next year. Also, we&#x27;ll be monitoring progress on inflation and the strength of the labor market.</p>
    <p>Interviewee: When you begin the cutting cycle, will it basically be trial-and-error, or will you tie it to some specific measure of progress?</p>
    <p>Chair Powell: We haven&#x27;t determined the specifics yet. That&#x27;s something we are just beginning to discuss.</p>
    <p>Interviewer: If the Fed cuts rates, as the dot plot shows, by about 75 basis points, does that signal a belief of weakness in the economy next year?</p>
    <p>Chair Powell: That&#x27;s not necessarily the case. If the rates are cut, it could simply mean that the economy doesn&#x27;t need tight policy, and it&#x27;s finally normalizing.</p>
    <p>Interviewer: Currently, how sticky is core inflation?</p>
    <p>Chair Powell: We&#x27;ve observed progress in core inflation. Service sector is thought to be stickier, but we&#x27;ve seen progress in non-housing services as well. Goods, housing services, and non-housing services are all contributing to core inflation.</p>
    <p>Interviewer: Given the recent positive data, how does this change your outlook on inflation?</p>
    <p>Chair Powell: Some participants did update their SEP forecasts based on recent data before it was too late to do so.</p>
    <p>Interviewee: Do you believe there have been fundamental structural shifts post-pandemic? How will that change your approach to rate cuts in the future?</p>
    <p>Chair Powell: Determining if there have been fundamental structural changes post-pandemic is challenging. One potential change could be the neutral rate of interest. For example, if it has risen, it could affect our approach to rate cuts.</p>
    <p>Chair Powell: Interest rates would need to be a bit higher to indicate a rise. However, this is not something we will know for sure. There will likely be debates and papers written about this topic for the next decade. It will always be a subject of uncertainty. Thus, our policy decisions need to be made in light of these uncertain, challenging, and unprecedented circumstances. We only know the natural rate of interest based on its impact, but it is tough to measure this because policy changes take time to show effect. This lag in results is why we have slowed down our pace this year.</p>
    <p>Interviewer: Has there been a shift in demand from services to goods?</p>
    <p>Chair Powell: There is a case to be made for this, but it&#x27;s not certain. It could be that individuals have purchased so much they do not need more. It&#x27;s difficult to say for sure.</p>
    <p>Interviewer: Jennifer Schoenberger from Yahoo Finance. You stated in July that you wanted to cut rates before hitting 2% inflation. With PCE inflation currently at three and a half percent (on core basis) and core PCE on a six-month annual basis at two and a half percent, how much closer does the rate need to get to 2% before you consider reductions?</p>
    <p>Chair Powell: It is not advisable to wait until we hit 2% to cut rates. This move would be too late. We want to reduce restrictions well in advance to avoid overshooting. I can&#x27;t provide an exact figure, but to get an idea of the potential timeline, you could refer to the SEP.</p>
    <p>Interviewer: Would 3% be a safe estimate?</p>
    <p>Chair Powell: I would refrain from pointing out a precise figure because it may end up being incorrect. We will be closely monitoring a wide range of factors.</p>
    <p>Interviewer: Gene Young from Market News. I wanted to further discuss the stubbornness of inflation. Many central bankers over the past years argued about the challenging final phase of bringing inflation down to 2%. However, it is surprising how rapidly inflation has declined this year. Do you think this observation suggests a new understanding of inflation, or that something different is at play in the U.S. economy?</p>
    <p>Chair Powell: We hypothesized that two factors would be necessary: the undoing of pandemic-induced distortions and our policy that eased aggregate demand. This unique inflation was not a classic demand surge, but rather a mix of robust demand and restraints on the supply side, such as labor shortages. This situation is extremely unusual. We believed that it demand went down, supply would as well, and that is indeed what happened. The question now is the timing and extent of further reductions in supply and demand. At a certain point, supply may stabilize, and demand will have to decrease further, which will prove to be more challenging.</p>
    <p>Megan: Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. Megan Casella with Barron 5. I want to ask about the balance sheet, given the Fed&#x27;s focus now on proceeding carefully and considering rate cuts. Can you talk us through what the latest thinking is, and has there been any consideration of altering the pace of quantitative tightening at all?</p>
    <p>Chair Powell: We&#x27;re not talking about altering the pace of QT right now, just to get that out of the way. So the balance sheet seems to be working pretty much as expected. What we&#x27;ve been seeing is, you know, that we&#x27;re allowing runoff each month. That&#x27;s adding up. I think we&#x27;re down, we&#x27;re close to 1.2 trillion now. That&#x27;s showing up. The reverse repo facility has been coming down quickly, and reserves have been either moving up or, as a result, or holding steady.</p>
    <p>Chair Powell: At a certain point, you know, there won&#x27;t be any more to come out of, but there&#x27;ll be a level where the reverse repo facility levels out, and at that point, reserves will start to come down. You know, we still have, you know, that we intend to reduce our securities holders until we judge that the quantity of reserve balances has reached a level somewhat above that consistent with ample reserves.</p>
    <p>Chair Powell: And we also intend to slow and then stop the decline in size of the balance sheet when reserve balances are somewhat above the level judged to be consistent with ample reserves. We&#x27;re not at those levels, you know, with reserves close to 3.5 trillion. We&#x27;re not, we don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re at those reserves. There isn&#x27;t a lot of evidence of that. We&#x27;re watching it carefully, and, you know, so far it&#x27;s working pretty much as expected, we think.</p>
    <p>Megan: Are you adjusting that thinking at all by the time you&#x27;re considering or moving forward with rate cuts? Is that time to rethink, or are you still going to follow that thinking?</p>
    <p>Chair Powell: So I think they&#x27;re on independent tracks. You&#x27;re asking, though, the question-I guess you&#x27;re implying the question of, can you do with QT at such time-QT, which is a tightening action-at such time as policy is still tight? And the answer is, it depends on the reason.</p>
    <p>Chair Powell: You know, if you&#x27;re cutting rates because you&#x27;re going back to normal, that&#x27;s one thing. If you&#x27;re cutting them because the economy is really weak. So you can imagine you have to know what the reason is to know whether it would be appropriate to do those two things at the same time. Thanks very much.</p>
    <p>Chair Powell: Thank you.</p>
